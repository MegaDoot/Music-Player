Run using Python 3.5+ 32-bit Windows computer.
Place avbin.dll in C:\Windows\System. There should be a folder called speech in it already (but no problems if there is not).
Python should be in your path variables. If this is not the case, it should work fine, but please report if this is not the case.
Uses pip to install: pyglet, sounfile, mutagen, libmagic & eyed3
If you (and, by extension, Python) do not have access privileges, you cannot use it.
